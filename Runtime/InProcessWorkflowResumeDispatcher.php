/**
 * The start of a run without a cluster (#976): the in-memory journal lives in this process, so the
 * process that starts a run executes it, in `dispatchNewWorkflowRun()`, before it returns.
 *
 * `MagentoRuntime::run()` does the work and bounds it with `budgetSeconds`. As on Temporal, where
 * the dispatch only starts the run, a run that fails does not throw from the dispatch: the failure
 * goes to the logger and stays in the journal. Only a start error throws, an undeclared workflow.
 * The resumes are no-ops: nothing else advances a run, and `run()` already drove it to its end.
 *
 * ponytail: it blocks the request, as `run()` does, up to `budgetSeconds`. That is the named
 * difference with Temporal (see the backends page). A web request that must not wait needs the
 * cluster (`durable/temporal/dsn`). The in-memory journal ends with the request, so the log line
 * is the only trace of a failure that remains.
